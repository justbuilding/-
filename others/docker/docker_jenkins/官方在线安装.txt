# RedHat Linux RPM packages for Jenkins

To use this repository, run the following command:

```
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
```

If you've previously imported the key from Jenkins, the "rpm --import" will fail because you already have a key. Please ignore that and move on.

You will need to explicitly install a Java runtime environment, because Oracle's Java RPMs are incorrect and fail to register as providing a java dependency. Thus, adding an explicit dependency requirement on Java would force installation of the OpenJDK JVM.



- 2.164 (2019-02) and newer: Java 8 or Java 11
- 2.54 (2017-04) and newer: Java 8
- 1.612 (2015-05) and newer: Java 7

With that set up, the Jenkins package can be installed with:

```
yum install jenkins
```
